# react-netlify-identity

> [Netlify Identity](https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-RNI&utm_campaign=devex) + React Hooks, with Typescript. Bring your own UI!

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-netlify-identity.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-netlify-identity) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

Use [Netlify Identity](https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-RNI&utm_campaign=devex) easier with React! This is a thin wrapper over the [gotrue-js](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue-js) library for easily accessing Netlify Identity functionality in your app, with React Context and Hooks. Types are provided.

Three demos:

- [a full demo here](https://netlify-gotrue-in-react.netlify.com/) with [source code](https://github.com/netlify/create-react-app-lambda/tree/reachRouterAndGoTrueDemo/src)
- [example with Reach Router](https://github.com/sw-yx/react-netlify-identity/tree/master/examples/example-reach-router) with [a demo hosted here](https://react-netlify-identity.netlify.com) and [deployed logs here](https://app.netlify.com/sites/react-netlify-identity/deploys)
- [example with React Router](https://github.com/sw-yx/react-netlify-identity/tree/master/examples/example-react-router) with [a demo hosted here](https://react-netlify-identity-example.netlify.com)

**This library is not officially maintained by Netlify.** This is written by swyx for his own use (and others with like minds üòé) and will be maintained as a personal project unless formally adopted by Netlify. See below for official alternatives.

## List of Alternatives

**Lowest level JS Library**: If you want to use the official Javascript bindings to GoTrue, Netlify's underlying Identity service written in Go, use https://github.com/netlify/gotrue-js

**React bindings**: If you want a thin wrapper over Gotrue-js for React, `react-netlify-identity` is a "headless" library, meaning there is no UI exported and you will write your own UI to work with the authentication. https://github.com/sw-yx/react-netlify-identity. If you want a drop-in UI, there is yet another library that wraps `react-netlify-identity`: https://github.com/sw-yx/react-netlify-identity-widget

**High level overlay**: If you want a "widget" overlay that gives you a nice UI out of the box, with a somewhat larger bundle, check https://github.com/netlify/netlify-identity-widget

**High level popup**: If you want a popup window approach also with a nice UI out of the box, and don't mind the popup flow, check https://github.com/netlify/netlify-auth-providers

## Typescript

Library is written in Typescript. File an issue if you find any problems.

## Install

```bash
yarn add react-netlify-identity
```

## Usage

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** You will need to have an active Netlify site running with Netlify Identity turned on. [Click here for instructions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/#getting-started?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-RNI&utm_campaign=devex) to get started/double check that it is on. We will need your site's url (e.g. `https://mysite.netlify.com`) to initialize `IdentityContextProvider`.

**When you call useIdentityContext()**, you can destructure these variables and methods:

- `user: User`
- `setUser`: directly set the user object. Not advised; use carefully!! mostly you should use the methods below
- `isConfirmedUser: boolean`: if they have confirmed their email
- `isLoggedIn: boolean`: if the user is logged in
- `signupUser(email: string, password: string, data: Object, directLogin: boolean = true)`
  - `directLogin` will internally set state to the newly created user
  - `isConfirmedUser` will be false
  - `isLoggedIn` will be true
  - setting `directLogin` to false won't trigger the state
- `loginUser(email: string, password: string, remember: boolean = true)` - we default the `remember` term to `true` since you'll usually want to remember the session in localStorage. set it to false if you need to
- `logoutUser()`
- `requestPasswordRecovery(email: string)`
- `updateUser(fields: object)`: see [updateUser @ gotrue-js](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue-js#update-a-user)
- `getFreshJWT()`
- `authedFetch(endpoint: string, obj: RequestInit = {})` a thin axios-like wrapper over `fetch` that has the user's JWT attached, for convenience pinging Netlify Functions with Netlify Identity
- `recoverAccount(remember?: boolean)`: verifies and consumes the recovery token caught by `runRoutes`, sets user on success
- `param: TokenParam`
  - a token exposing Netlify tokens a dev has to implement the actions for; namely `invite`, `recovery`, `email_change` and `access_denied`
  - **important:** tokens this package exposes no methods for are automatically handled and will not be passed down - see [runRoutes implementation](https://github.com/sw-yx/react-netlify-identity/master/src/runRoutes.tsx)
  - if you don't want this behaviour (added [here](https://github.com/sw-yx/react-netlify-identity/issues/12) in v.0.1.8), pass `runRoutes={false}` to the exposed hook
  - for further reference, please check the [type definition](https://github.com/sw-yx/react-netlify-identity/tree/master/src/token.ts)
  - an example implementation for a Recovery process can be found below
- `verifyToken()`
  - consumes & verifies TokenParam based on the type and tries to retrieve a valid user object
  - devs duty to show password field to afterwards call `signupUser(user.email, newPassword)`

```tsx
import React from 'react';

import { IdentityContextProvider } from 'react-netlify-identity';

function App() {
  const url = 'https://your-identity-instance.netlify.com/'; // supply the url of your Netlify site instance. VERY IMPORTANT. no point putting in env var since this is public anyway
  return (
    <IdentityContextProvider url={url}>
      {/* rest of your app */}
    </IdentityContextProvider>
  );
}
```

<h3>
  How to handle a Recovery Action (since v0.2)
</h3>
</summary>

Of course you can alternatively inline this logic into app.

```tsx
import { useIdentityContext } from 'react-netlify-identity';
import {
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Switch,
  Route,
  useLocation,
  useHistory,
} from 'react-router-dom';

export default function App() {
  const { isLoggedIn } = useIdentityContext();

  return (
    <Router>
      <CatchNetlifyRecoveryNullComponent />
      <Switch>
        {isLoggedIn ? (
          <>
            <Route path="/dashboard" exact component={DashboardPage} />
            <Route component={() => <Redirect to="/dashbard" />} />
          </>
        ) : (
          <>
            <Route path="/" exact component={LandingPage} />
            <Route path="/register" exact component={RegisterPage} />
            <Route path="/login" exact component={LoginPage} />
            {/* etc */}
            <Route path="/recovery" exact component={RecoveryPage} />
            <Route component={() => <Redirect to="/" />} />
          </>
        )}
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}

function CatchNetlifyRecoveryNullComponent() {
  const {
    param: { token, type },
  } = useIdentityContext();
  const { replace } = useHistory();
  const { pathname } = useLocation();

  // important to check for the current pathname here because else you land
  // in a infinite loop
  if (token && type === 'recovery' && pathname === '/') {
    replace(`/recovery`, { token });
  }

  return null;
}

function RecoveryPage() {
  const {
    location: { state },
  } = useHistory();
  // this state _might_ not be needed, it was needed in my specific implementation
  const [token] = useState(state?.token);

  return null; // set new password in a form and call updateUser
}
```

</details>

## Lower level API: `useNetlifyIdentity`

If you'd like to handle your own context yourself, you can use this library as a hook as well:

```tsx
function useNetlifyIdentity(
  url: string,
  onAuthChange: authChangeParam = () => {},
  enableRunRoutes: boolean = true
): ReactNetlifyIdentityAPI;
```
